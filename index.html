        <h2>Our solidaritary action: </h2>

        <p> As IESEG students, we want to help UNICEF to collect funds through actions. Our action aims to encounter as much people as possible to make them know more about children lifes in North Kivu. You can know much more about our team members below. </p>

        <h2>Unicef's Program in RDC</h2>

        <p>This project specifically targets children affected by armed militia violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It consists of transitional care for war-affected children and the implementation of pilot programmes for socio-economic integration in urban areas. UNICEF has set a main objective which consists of coordinating local actors in North Kivu. In addition, UNICEF is trying to help 80% of the targeted children to benefit from protection measures in the region. You'll discover more about Unicef's program and our team's action below.</p>
